# Koans

## Welcome

These are my personal koans that I've been practicing several different languages with. While there's no fancy way to run everything, the idea is that I work on one koan and one language at a time and run it until it builds.

## Languages

You'll need to find the compilers and runtimes for all of these languages to work.

### C

To compile and run a C koan, use the following commands:

```
gcc -o /bin/name_of_executable koans/name_of_koan.c
./name_of_executable
```

### C#

The C# project is setup to run all koans. Simply run:

```
dotnet run
```

### EcmaScript

The EcmaScript project is using npm. Run:

```
npm start
```

### Go

```
go run go_filename.go
```

### Python

```
python filename.py
```

### TypeScript

To run the Koans for TypeScript, execute the following commands:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Hello World

Why Hello, World? Well, we learn:

1. How files are named and cased.
2. A small bit of how a basic program is structured.
3. Declaring a string type.
4. Using the language or library to output to the console.
5. How to compile.
6. How to execute.
